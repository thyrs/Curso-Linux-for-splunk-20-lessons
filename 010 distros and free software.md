### Linux Distributions
A __Linux distribution__ is a __complete operating system__ that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, and other software. It is designed to provide users with a functional and cohesive environment for various computing tasks.

#### Key Components of a Linux Distribution:
1. __Kernel__: The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources.
2. __Shell__: A command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.
3. __Programs__: Various applications and utilities that provide functionality to the user.

### Common Linux Distributions
- __Ubuntu Linux LTS__: Based on __Debian__, it offers long-term support (__LTS__) versions with regular security updates.
- __Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)__: An __enterprise-grade__ distribution known for its robust support and __security updates__.
- __CentOS__: Derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (__RHEL__), CentOS is ideal for those who want to use RHEL knowledge __without paying__ for a subscription.
- __Debian GNU/Linux__: Known for its stability and extensive package repository.

### Free Software (Libre) 
<!--! free =/ gratis | FREE = libre -->
Free Software refers to software that grants users the freedom to run, modify, distribute, and share it. This concept is governed by specific licenses that ensure these freedoms are maintained.

#### Characteristics of Free Software:
1. __Modifiable by Anyone__: Users can change the source code as needed.
2. __Conditions for Modifying and Distributing__: Defined by Free Software licenses like GPL (General Public License).
3. __Copyleft Principle__: Ensures that modified versions of free software remain free.

### Important Concepts
- __Copyleft__: A licensing principle requiring derivative works to be distributed under the same license as the original work.
- __Enterprise Grade Distributions__:
  - Ubuntu LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - CentOS
